# Redux Tutorials Index

We have two different sets of tutorials:

- The [**Redux Essentials tutorial**](./essentials/part-1-overview-concepts) is a "top-down" tutorial that teaches "how to use Redux the right way", using our latest recommended APIs and best practices.
- The [**Redux Fundamentals tutorial**](./fundamentals/part-1-overview.md) is a "bottom-up" tutorial that teaches "how Redux works" from first principles and without any abstractions, and why standard Redux usage patterns exist.

:::tip

**We recommend starting with the [Redux Essentials tutorial](./essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)**, since it covers the key points you need to know about how to get started using Redux to write actual applications.
